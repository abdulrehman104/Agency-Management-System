## 1. **Multivendor B2B2B SaaS**

- This feature enables multiple businesses (vendors) to operate within a single SaaS platform, where one business can sell services to another, and that business can provide those services to a third party. It creates a complex network for vendors to interact across different business lines. The system can manage different vendors, each with their own accounts, data, and settings. This is ideal for agencies or large corporations that need to manage multiple clients or branches with a single platform.

## 2. **Agency and Sub Accounts**
